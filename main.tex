\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The historical legacy by which Scotland was intertwined with England, formalised through the Acts of Union in 1707, has deeply shaped national narratives of the country´s role within British colonialism and the transatlantic slave trade. Often presenting itself as the lesser partner rather that the active agent of the imperial expansion, Scotland has managed to evade a thorough acknowledgment of its colonial past. But increasing demands for historical accountability especially during the Black Lives Matter protest of 2020 have contested these narratives, reopening discussions about Scotland´s connection to slavery and its ongoing manifestation in the build environment. This article focuses on the contestations around the Melville Monument, in St Andrew´s square in Edinburgh, a spot that manifests and testifies Scotland´s economic ties to colonial economy. Following the trajectory of the dispute from an early petition for a commemorative plaque to its placement and subsequent contestation, we identify the principal motivation of key stakeholders, the developed public discourse surrounding this monument, and reflect upon the significance of this site and the events surrounding it for heritage policy in Scotland. It also situates the ease within the wider European context of contested heritage, de-colonial movements, and unconventional forms of historical tribute. Thus, this work contributes to the ongoing discussion on public space´s to impact historical memory and challenge the conventional narratives in postcolonial societies by examining institutional and community response to the crisis through art interventions.

\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item context on the nation-state 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For context of construction of Melville's monument see \cite{godard_2018}
    \end{itemize}
    \item cast light on European contexts (shaped by different colonial and imperial histories and racial formations)
\end{itemize}

 The enduring legacies of the transatlantic slave trade continue to provoke critical re-evaluation of national narratives and heritage policies across Europe. To understand the complexities of these legacies, we must first acknowledge the nation-state not as an immutable entity, but as a historically contingent construct. 

This construction, however, is not neutral; it often serves to consolidate power, privilege certain histories, and obscure uncomfortable truths. In the context of European colonialism and the slave trade, the nation-state became a vehicle for legitimizing and perpetuating systems of exploitation. Consequently, the narratives that support the national identity are frequently intertwined with the histories of empire and racialized power, demanding a critical perspective that recognizes the selective nature of historical memory and the continuous challenge of decolonizing national consciousness.  
The ongoing interrogation of historical legacies stemming from the transatlantic slave trade has led to a critical reflection  on national narratives and heritage policies across Europe. 

David Theo Goldberg's concept of the "racial state" and Benedict Anderson's theory of "imagined communities" offer powerful frameworks for examining Scotland's complex colonial heritage, particularly as it relates to symbols like the Melville Monument.

Goldberg's "Racial State" highlights how modern states are fundamentally structured around racial hierarchies, not merely as an incidental feature.\textsuperscript{1} This lens allows us to analyze how Scotland, as part of the British Empire, actively participated in and benefited from systems of racial domination. The Melville Monument, a tribute to a figure deeply implicated in colonial exploitation, stands as a testament to this. It underscores how the "racial state" constructs and maintains narratives that celebrate imperial figures, often obscuring their role in perpetuating racial injustice. In this context, the monument becomes a symbol of the state's investment in upholding a particular racial order, reflecting the enduring legacy of colonial power within Scotland.
As Anderson (2006) argues, national identity is an "imagined community," constructed through shared narratives and symbols, often obscuring or sanitizing uncomfortable historical realities. \cite{anderson_2020}{p. 15}
This article extends beyond a purely national framework by casting light on the diverse European contexts that have shaped, and continue to be shaped by, different colonial and imperial histories and racial formations.
Europe's engagement with the slave trade was not uniform; rather, it involved a complex web of actors, institutions, and ideologies that produced distinct racialized hierarchies and power structures (Goldberg, 2002) \cite{goldberg_2002}.
Consequently, the legacies of slavery manifest differently across European nations, necessitating a nuanced approach that considers the specific historical trajectories and cultural contexts of each region.
In Scotland, as demonstrated by the works of Alston \cite{alston_2021} and studies of the "Glasgow Sugar Aristocracy," the economic and social impact of slavery was profound, yet often obscured by narratives of Scottish exceptionalism.

Two authors whose decolonial theories resonate strongly with the Melville Monument debate are Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o and Eve Tuck. Ngũgĩ's emphasis on "decolonizing the mind" highlights the importance of reclaiming cultural identity and challenging the dominance of colonial languages and perspectives.
In the context of the Melville Monument, this translates to questioning the very narratives that justified its erection, demanding a critical reevaluation of the historical figures it celebrates, and actively seeking to center the voices and experiences of those marginalized by colonial legacies. Similarly, Tuck's work on \textbf{"decolonization is not a metaphor"} emphasizes the need to move beyond symbolic gestures and address the tangible harms of colonialism, including land dispossession and the erasure of Indigenous knowledges. In the context of the Melville Monument, this translates to demanding concrete actions, such as removing the monument or recontextualizing it, rather than simply engaging in abstract discussions about its meaning. 

Both wa Thiong'o  and Tuck underscore that decolonization is an ongoing process of dismantling not just physical structures but also the mental and cultural frameworks that perpetuate colonial power, making their theories particularly relevant to debates surrounding contested monuments. They highlight the ongoing nature of colonial power and the necessity of challenging its manifestations in concrete and meaningful ways, making their theories highly relevant to the debates surrounding contested monuments.  

This article contributes to this discourse by examining the intertwined histories of Scotland and the Caribbean, focusing on the enduring impact of slavery and its subsequent memorialization within the Scottish metropolis (p.107).\cite{godard_2018} 
The nation-state, as a construct, is not a singular or static entity but rather a product of specific historical forces, including colonialism and imperialism .To fully grasp its nature, it is essential to recognize how it has both shaped and been shaped by these forces, particularly in the context of European expansion and exploitation.

Furthermore, the memorialization of this history, as exemplified by monuments like the Melville Monument \cite{godard_2018}{p. 16}, reveals how dominant narratives have been embedded within the urban landscape, reinforcing particular interpretations of the past.2 The increasing demands for apologies and reparations \cite{hartel_2024}, driven by anti-racist and decolonial movements, highlight the ongoing contestation of these narratives and the urgent need for a critical reassessment of heritage narratives. This article aims to contribute to this reassessment by analysing the interplay between historical scholarship, memorialization, and contemporary debates on historical justice, ultimately revealing the dynamic evolution of heritage policies within the context of anti-racist and decolonial movements.

\section{Existing Work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item expose discussion and evolution of heritage policies within the context of antiracist and decolonial movements
    \item critical review of relevant literature.
\end{itemize}

This review examines key works that contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex and often obscured legacies of the transatlantic slave trade in Scotland and Britain, and how these legacies are being re-evaluated within the context of anti-racist and decolonial movements: David Alston's "Slaves and Highlanders: Silenced Histories of Scotland and the Caribbean" \cite{alston_2021}, an analysis of the "Glasgow Sugar Aristocracy" \cite{mullen_2022} Lisa Ellen Hartel's "Legacies of the Slave Trade: An Analysis of Demands, Apologies and Reparations in Britain over the Last 25 Years" \cite{hartel_2024} , and Clarisse Godard Desmarest's "The Melville Monument and the Shaping of the Scottish Metropolis" (2018) \cite{godard_2018}.
Alston's "Slaves and Highlanders" provides a crucial corrective to the prevailing narratives that often minimize or overlook Scotland's role in the slave system. 
Alston reveals the extent to which wealth derived from enslaved labour permeated Scottish society by focusing on the disproportionate involvement of Highland Scots, particularly in the later stages of the slave trade.
By meticulously documenting the presence of Highlanders as plantation owners, managers, and merchants in the Caribbean he challenges the "silenced histories".
This work highlights the importance of regional specificity in understanding the impact of slavery, demonstrating how certain communities within Britain were deeply entangled in the system.
 Furthermore, moving beyond a purely economic analysis and laying groundwork for decolonial readings of Scottish history, Alston's commitment to amplifying the voices of the enslaved and free people of colour underscores the human cost of this historical relationship.
The study of the "Glasgow Sugar Aristocracy" is complementing Alston's regional focus and expands the analysis to encompass the broader economic impact of Caribbean slavery on British society. It examines the role of West India merchants and planters in shaping the economic landscape of Glasgow, highlighting the flow of capital from the colonies to the metropole. This work emphasizes the interconnectedness of colonial and metropolitan economies, demonstrating how profits from enslaved labor fueled industrial and agricultural development in Britain. Focusing on the "repatriated slavery fortunes," it provides insights into the tangible ways in which wealth derived from slavery was integrated into British society, thereby informing contemporary discussions on reparative justice.
Stephen Mullen's "The Glasgow Sugar Aristocracy" offers essential context for understanding the controversy surrounding the Melville Monument by revealing the profound economic ties between Glasgow's elite and the institution of slavery. The book meticulously documents how a powerful "sugar aristocracy" in Glasgow amassed immense wealth through the Caribbean sugar trade, a system entirely reliant on the forced labor of enslaved Africans. This accumulation of wealth was not merely a matter of private fortunes; it directly financed the rapid growth of Glasgow and significantly contributed to the social and political prominence of individuals like Henry Dundas. 
Mullen's research underscores the substantial political influence exerted by this sugar aristocracy, demonstrating how they effectively shaped policies to safeguard their economic interests, most notably the perpetuation of slavery. Henry Dundas, a key figure commemorated by the Melville Monument, was deeply embedded within this influential network, both benefiting from and actively reinforcing the very system that generated such vast wealth. Therefore, Mullen's work provides a crucial economic context for Dundas's actions, illustrating how his decisions regarding the slave trade were inextricably linked to the financial interests of this powerful elite. It highlights the significant economic motivation that was behind the delay of the abolition of the slave trade.
By exposing the deep and pervasive connections between Scottish wealth and the exploitation of enslaved people, Mullen's research challenges the uncritical celebration of figures like Dundas, which the Melville Monument represents. It demonstrates that the wealth that funded the monument, and indeed much of the city's development, was directly built upon the labor and suffering of enslaved individuals. Finally, Mullen’s work shows the important transnational connection between Scotland and the Caribbean, that is the foundation of the wealth that paid for the monument, thus providing a global context to a local debate.

Hartel's contemporary analysis, "Legacies of the Slave Trade," brings the discussion into the present day, examining the evolving discourse surrounding Britain's historical responsibility.
Her work reveals the significant increase in demands for apologies and reparations over the past 25 years, reflecting a growing awareness of the enduring legacies of slavery.
Hartel's analysis of the reparations debate highlights the complexities and challenges associated with addressing historical injustices, including the different forms reparations might take and the political and social obstacles to their implementation.
This work underscores the ongoing struggle to reconcile with the past and the need for a more nuanced understanding of historical accountability, directly impacting and being impacted by, the evolution of heritage policies within anti-racist movements.
Collectively, these works contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted legacies of slavery in Scotland and Britain.
Alston's work emphasizes the regional specificity and human cost of the system, while Mullen's  study of the "Glasgow Sugar Aristocracy" illuminates the economic impact on the metropole.

Clarice Godart Desmartest “The Melville Monument and the Shaping of the Scottish Metropolis” examines the construction of the Melville Monument in Edinburgh, focusing on its imperial context and the political tensions surrounding its completion. It explores the monument's commission, design, and the various proposed locations, ultimately settling on St. Andrew's Square. The author argues that the monument, dedicated to Henry Dundas, reflects Scotland's complex relationship with the British Empire and its efforts to assert national identity within the Union and highlights how the monument visualises the wider impact of money derived from slavery on the urban landscape of Edinburgh. Indeed much of the city's development, was directly built upon the labor and suffering of enslaved individuals. Finally as Mullen’s and Alston’s work discuss the important transnational connection between Scotland and the Caribbean, that is the foundation of the wealth that paid for the monument, Desmartest discusses the significance of monuments in shaping the city's identity. Godard Desmarest demonstrates how these economic and political powers were visually expressed and preserved in the metropolitan landscape and how that landscape is being contested. 

Hartel's contemporary analysis demonstrates the ongoing struggle to address historical injustices and the enduring relevance of the reparations debate, and how that struggle is shaping and being shaped by the evolution of heritage policies within anti-racist and decolonial movements.
By combining historical research with contemporary analysis of both written and built history, these works provide a critical foundation for understanding the complex and enduring legacies of slavery in British society and the ongoing efforts to decolonize its historical narratives.

\subsubsection{To Add to Timeline}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Spat between Palmer and  Hearn, McCarthy, Devine and Rowlands
\end{itemize}

\begin{quotation}
    Can one wonder that Dundas, 
            opposing Wilberforce’s motion of 1792, 
                    on the ground that abolition should be: 
                    “gradual, that is, that time should be allowed to the planters to purchase sufficient supplies so that they should be well stocked when abolition took place,'' ?
    Can one wonder that Dundas, 
                                            %so determined an enemy of abolition, 
    moved the immediate abolition of the foreign slave trade, 
     which, 
                                             %according to him, 
    amounted in 1791 to 34,000 out of 74,000 imported?
\end{quotation}
\cite{williams_1938}

but williams also says

\begin{quotation}
    Even Dundas, who was in reality the friend of the West Indians [plantation owners], admitted that the desire to increase the cultivation of the West Indian Islands was no good cause for continuing so unjust a traffic as the slave trade. Page 20
\end{quotation} 
see \cite{williams_1938}[Page 27-28]

\subsubsection{A Note on Dates}

I have found it fascinating how sloppy the citing of key dates is when trying to assemble a timeline. This speaks more to the the methodology side side, but even after just a couple of years, the certainty around  key dates becomes tarnished, in particular the date the plaque was installed, the date it was removed and when it was reinstalled.

    \item human rights activist \textbf{Adam Ramsay} , plaque committee member \cite{c4n_2018}
    \item Caribbean historian\textbf{ Eric Williams} (described Dundas as a determined ‘enemy of abolition’) \cite{mullen_2021}
    \item  Melville Monument Committee
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Bobby Dundas}: 10th Viscount Melville and plaque committee member \cite{c4n_2018}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Benjamin Carey}: Dundas descendant who called for the plaque
    \item \textbf{Professor Guy Rowlands}:  Professor of History at St Andrews \textit{has also judged the plaque ‘deeply misleading’ and ‘egregiously unfair’}  \cite{mccarthy_2022, rowlands_2021}
    \item \textbf{Tom Devine}: Critical of Dundas \cite{devine_2015}, but critical also of the wording of the new plaque. Was in a public spat with Geoff Palmer.
    \item \textbf{Jonathan Hearn}: Professor in historical sociology at the University of Edinburgh
    \item \textbf{Angela McCarthy}: New Zealand academic in the field of Scottish migrations. Like Devine, critical of Dundas but also of the ESCLRG report \cite{esclr_2022}
\item \textbf{Michael Fry}: Scottish Historian and Biographer of Dundas \cite{fry_1992}. Plaque committee member \cite{c4n_2018} \cite{mccarthy_2022_1}\footnote{Possibly from \url{https://www.thenational.scot/comment/18519171.real-truth-henry-dundas-whether-prolonged-slavery/}}
\item \textbf{Lisa Williams}: (Research Associate at the Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh and an Honorary Fellow in the School of History, Classics and Archaeology at the University of Edinburgh.)
\item \textbf{Henry Dundas}: 1st Viscount Melville,  Lord of Trade (1784–1786), Home Secretary (1791–1794), President of the Board of Control for East India Company (1793–1801), Secretary at War (1794–1801) and First Lord of the Admiralty (1804–1805), Secretary of War.

\end{itemize}

\begin{quotation}
    Henry Dundas, who presided over colonial affairs as Pitt’s Home
Secretary, who sat as president of the East India Company Board of
Control, and who, in Dale H. Porter’s words, “‘controlled much of the
patronage in both ends of the Empire and influenced the votes of
thirty-four Scots M.P.’s and eleven Scots peers.”’? Dundas replied to
Wilberforce’s proposal by arguing that the condition of West Indian
slaves must be improved before imports from Africa could be stopped;
he therefore moved to amend Wilberforce’s motion by adding the
word “gradually.” On the morning of April 3, the House accepted
Dundas’s amendment by a majority of 193 to 125, and then passed the
resolution favoring gradual abolition of the slave trade by a vote of
230 to 85

when the Commons had finally settled on the year 1796 as the
terminal date for the slave trade, Dundas had resigned the bill to the abolitionists
``to do what they please with it.'' I In fact, Dundas consistently opposed later abolition bills


Although Dundas’s motion pleased neither the West Indians nor
the abolitionists, it precisely answered the needs of Parliament, which
could now become a “temple of benevolence” without sanctioning a
“sudden interruption” in the pursuit of business. Dundas’s plea for
moderation allowed Fox to declaim to the crowded galleries, asking
whether murder and theft were more justified when done with mod-
eration. Pitt, in what was generally regarded as the most eloquent
speech of his career, talked of the forgiveness of Heaven, of “the guilt
and shame with which we are now covered,” and of the sublime
prospect of civilizing Africa as a means of national redemption. If
Parliament had decided that the slave trade was unjust, he asked, “why
ought it not to be abolished by the vote of this night?” But Pitt also
applauded the fact that the dispute had been narrowed to “mere”
differences over when the trade should end. By agreeing on the goal
of ultimate abolition, the House had redeemed its moral character.
The majority of members who voted for Dundas’s amendment evinced
a sensible fear of “hasty or precipitous” action, but there could be no
question that their hearts were in the right place.*°

 Dundas had no intention of introducing a bill for gradual
abolition, and Wilberforce refused to do so on grounds of moral
principle. It was Fox who finally forced Dundas to offer a bill, and
Pitt who finally secured the bill’s passage. But when the House agreed
to 1796 as a terminal date for the slave trade, Dundas completely
dissociated himself from the measure
\end{quotation}
\cite{davis_1975}{p. 431-432}

\textit{Professor Sir Geoff Palmer, Jamaica’s first honorary consul in Scotland, and the human rights activist Adam Ramsay led a high-profile campaign to reword the plaque on Edinburgh’s Melville monument, upon which a statute of Henry Dundas is mounted}\cite{mullen_2022}

\subsubsection{Note on Social Class In the UK}

This is a little hand wavy, but I feel it is worth noting social classic as a vector of influence in the debate. Those in standing in defence of Dundas are typically from monied or higher class backgrounds. Bobby Dundas is obviously a descendant of Dundas (rather that we don't look too closely lest the source of wealth is brought into question). Michael Fry , not much in way of history, but attended University of Oxford. Enrolment at Oxford is massively skewed to higher classes / privately educated individuals, especially at the time Fry attended. Not a stretch to assume Fry has upper class leanings.    

Contrast with Geoff Palmer and Tom Devine. Devine is from a working class Scottish background. Geoff Palmer is Jamaican, mother was Windrush. It  is probable that the friction between Devine and palmer comes from their separate experience, in particular Devine who had not experienced a side of the UK that Palmer would have.

In the UK Class divides people sooner than race compared to many other nations. However, those from different racial background would likely disagree at how quickly ``class over race'' as a rule for order of precedence in societal divisions.  Palmer and Devine come from very different racial backgrounds, with Palmer experiencing a side of the UK that Devine has not. This  is particularly pertinent when Devine is declaring what is and what is not important with respect to the removal or renaming of places as it relates to Afro-Caribbean black history and slavery.

\subsection{The Debate}

\begin{itemize}
    \item public debate about Melville monument in Scotland
    \begin{itemize}
        \item it's origin
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item and about the monument
    \end{itemize}
    \item identify the different actors involved in this debate
    \begin{itemize}
        \item analyse their discourses
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The debate centres around Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville and whether the changes he made for `gradual' implementation to legislation presented by William Wilberforce on the abolition.

\begin{quotation}
    He spoke during parliamentary debates on abolition of the British slave trade, including in 1792 when he proposed a motion for gradual delay when the House of Commons was set to reject William Wilberforce’s proposal for abolition. 
\end{quotation}
\cite{mullen_2021}

To over simplify, the debate rests on two sides:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Henry Dundas knowingly delayed the cessation of the slave trade to the benefit of xx
    \begin{itemize}
        \item assumes that Dundas would gain from the delay.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Henry Dundas saved the legislation by adding the `gradual' clause to make it more palatable 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item assumes the legislation was guaranteed to fail without intervention
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

During the Black Lives Matter demonstration in Edinburgh in June 2020 the monuments to Dundas and his son were a focal point and targeted with graffiti (Image Needed). 

It is popularly reported that the debate began with these demonstration, but a petition was made and approved 4 years previous in 2016 by Adam Ramsay \cite{mullen_2021} for a new plaque outlining who Dundas was and the controversies of his actions. Wording of the plaque was assigned to a committee which included at least Michael Fry, a Dundas biographer and ``defender \textit{par excellence}'' \cite{mccarthy_2022_1}, but it languished for a number of years.

In response to the protests the Edinburgh City Council pushed for the new plaque to be finished with Sir Geoff Palmer advising. Professional historians were absent from the process of deciding the wording \cite{scotsman_2022}. NOTE: There is equally no coverage of who was approached to be part of the plaque committee or the ESCLRG and it is equally possible some historians were asked to participate, but none showed interest.

The call for a plaque has been portrayed as something that has erupted \cite{daily_2017}, rush or reactionary. Whereas the conversation on a plaque specifically has been going since 2016 (sparked from a trip to Berlin [ramsay article] and not Black Lives Matter). If you extend to academic criticism of Dundas, that extends to 1938 with \cite{williams_1938} and 1975 \cite{davis_1975}

    Bobby Dundas had previously criticised the inscription as being written by "non-historians at the height of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations in 2020".

\subsubsection{Alternate Heritage Practice}

With respect to ``alternate heritage practices'', there is a Edinburgh Black History Walking Tour which begins at the Melville Monument.
The walking tour is headed by Lisa Williams, founder of the Edinburgh Caribbean Association, Research Associate at the Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh, and an Honorary Fellow in the School of History, Classics and Archaeology at the University of Edinburgh.

    the controversial plaque on the side of the Melville Monument. It's so tiny and unobtrusive that no one can read it, and maybe that's just as well
\end{quotation}


\paragraph{Vandalism as Heritage Practice}

Graffiti, vandalism, Ramsay's Plaque (Figure \ref{fig:ramsay-plaque})

Adam Ramsay's placement of the plaque on the Melville Monument can be interpreted as a form of conceptual art, utilizing the monument itself to dismantle the very narratives it was designed to uphold, thus exposing the stark contrast in historical interpretations. As a site-specific intervention, the plaque was intrinsically linked to the monument, altering its perception and engaging directly with its environment. Functioning as powerful social commentary, the act addressed critical issues of historical injustice and racial inequality, mirroring art's frequent role in social critique and activism. Furthermore, the plaque's intent to provoke thought and dialogue about history, memory, and power aligns with the goals of conceptual art, and its subsequent sparking of significant public debate fulfills art's capacity to challenge conventional perspectives.

\begin{quotation}
\textit{The disparate amount of attention paid to acts of graffiti by heritage professionals, who act as constructors of identity, represents a form of avoidance and exclusion.}
\end{quotation}
\cite{merrill_2011}
The graffiti appearing on the Melville Monument and the Robert Dundas statue can be understood as a potent act of "reclaiming the space," directly challenging traditional interpretations and sparking public debate, as framed by Samuel Oliver Crichton Merrill's exploration of "Graffiti at Heritage Places." Unlike official narratives that often celebrate colonial figures, this graffiti serves as a direct, unfiltered expression of contemporary dissent and historical re-evaluation, offering a visual counter-narrative to the monuments' established symbolism. Drawing on Merrill's concept of "vandalism as cultural significance," these markings transform sites of uncritical commemoration into arenas for active resistance and dialogue. As Merrill observes, the line between vandalism and cultural expression is often blurred, and this graffiti allows marginalized voices to reclaim public space, challenging dominant historical narratives. This practice signals a shift towards participatory heritage, where communities actively engage with and reinterpret their historical landscape. Acting as a form of public inscription, the graffiti allows the public to have a direct say in their city's heritage, reflecting Merrill's observation that public perception of graffiti varies and influences heritage management. Moreover, as Merrill notes, graffiti can acquire cultural significance over time, contributing to a site's evolving narrative. This raises critical questions for heritage managers about balancing historical authenticity with contemporary cultural practices, highlighting the dynamic and contested nature of heritage interpretation.




\subsection{St. Andrew's Square Now}

St. Andrew's Square as it stands now, a year after the replacement plaque was installed.

There are 4 plaques placed in St. Andrew's Square that relate to the Melville monument that will be referred to as: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Original: The plaque installed in 18xx to commemorate $N$ years after the monument \ref{fig:original_plaque}
    \item Updated: The Plaque installed in 2021 with rewording from Edinburgh Slavery and Colonialism Legacy Review Group
    \item Stevenson: A Plaque to Engineer Robert Stevenson (Figure \ref{fig:stevenson_plaque}) \footnote{from Copyright Kenneth Allen and licensed for reuse under Creative Commons Licence 2.0} also located on the base of the Melville Monument.
    \item Temporary: 2 Free Standing Information Board intended to be a ``temporary'' feature (Figure \ref{fig:temp_info}). From press coverage, this board appears to have moved location in the square at least twice. Qr code on monument lead to an inactive page, the contents are still available via the archive.org's wayback machine \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20220824121916/https://ewh.org.uk/iconic-buildings-and-monuments/the-melville-monument/}
\end{itemize}

Text for all plaque figures can be found in section \ref{sec:plaque-text}.

The updated plaque and Stevenson plaque are affixed to the base of the monument. The base is separated from the path by a lawn which contains no clear path to the base. The lawn has currently been dug up, likely due to hosting events during the Christmas period (Figure \ref{fig:melville-dirt}). The Stevenson Plaque is just visible in Figure \ref{fig:melville-dirt} and the updated plaque in Figure \ref{fig:melville-dirt-plaque}. Condition of the terrain means that the updated and Stevenson plaques are not easily read, and are in fact easy to miss. The original plaque sits to the western entrance of St Andrews Square, directly by the footpath. At the northeastern entrance, a temporary information board erected in 2021 explains plans for the plaque and some history of the debate and context around it.

\subsection{Matthew's unorganised thoughts}

If you were to view the debate entirely through text it would seem that what is at stake is on one hand the openness and transparency of colonial history in Scotland and on the other an unnecessary tarnishing of a forward thinker whose actions were being viewed out of the context of their time. There have been accusations of of racism, unprofessional conduct and calls for some persons to lose their jobs as well as the perpetration of crimes.

When viewing the debate purely from the space, there was a flurry of activity around from 2020-2022 with some settling in the subsequent years. I would argue heritage concerns not the flurry of activity, but what settles afterwards and what has settles is one plaque out of three, that isn't even particularly accessible, making brief mention of consequences of someone's actions. All of that is on a monument that nobody even wanted in the first place \cite{godard_2018}.  Visitors are much more likely to just read the original plaque and take a photo with Paddington (Figure \ref{fig:paddington} ) than they are to take the muddy walk up to the base and engage with new plaque.

There is also a bit of a Streisand effect where more attention is brought to something the more resistance is put up. I would argue most residents of Edinburgh haven't given the monument a second thought outside of a point of interest.

The brass plaque was removed in 2023 but the information boards remained. The brass plaque couldn't even be read clearly. As a defiant act, removing the brass plaque seems a little impotent.

Commentary on the lack of historians suggests either

\begin{itemize}
    \item The input of non-historian stakeholders is illegitamate
    \item OR
    \item That legitimacy of stake-holders hinges on the presence of historians. (everyone is equal, only if a academic historian is there otherwise it is to be disregarded) Meaning that ``historians'' should get the final word.
\end{itemize}

    \item Dundas introduced the word ‘gradually’ to the motion of the leading parliamentary abolitionist, William Wilberforce, in the house of commons on 2 April 1792 that called for the immediate abolition of the slave trade (chattel slavery)
    \item Michael Fry has become the Dundas defender \textit{par excellence}
    \item then goes into detail about Dundas and the delay of slavery abolition

\end{itemize}

\url{https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/pdf/10.3366/scot.2022.0420}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{``My overarching argument is that Sir Geoff Palmer, the key figure behind the new plaque’s wording, has wrongly conflated arguments about whether or not Dundas was an abolitionist with assertions that he delayed abolition of Britain’s slave trade.''}
    \item focuses on the debacle surrounding the new Henry Dundas plaque
    \item ``\textit{For Robert Poll (2022), founder of Save our Statues, ‘We have entered a dangerous new era for the study of history, where debate is increasingly controlled, its terms of reference defined by one group with one particular agenda.’ }\textit{Palmer prefers ‘to project his own version of history onto them. And it very much is his version of history. The [Edinburgh Council] review has descended into chaos’. In this sense, Poll’s perspective reiterates broader concerns in public history that plaques have become ‘unadulterated propaganda’.}''
    \item \textit{such reinterpretations overlook the complexity of the past}
\end{itemize}

Side Note: McCarthy cites a bunch of tweets by Geoff Palmer amongst other, none of which is accessible and none of them are available in the main document. Also, those tweets are cited in the context of McCarthy directly defending themselves which in a published journal article is a level of petty infighting I don't think any party would put up with in a student paper.

Policy in Flux
The Melville Monument controversy serves as a crucial lens through which to examine the evolving nature of heritage policy in Scotland, particularly in response to contested colonial legacies. Demands for historical accountability, intensified by contemporary social movements, have reopened critical discussions about Scotland's connection to slavery, prompting a significant shift from traditional commemorative practices to a demand for critical engagement with problematic historical figures. This shift has placed increasing pressure on heritage institutions to address Scotland's involvement in the transatlantic slave trade and to re-evaluate the narratives embedded within public monuments. The dispute surrounding the commemorative plaque, a direct reflection of the Melville Monument's manifestation of Scotland's economic ties to the colonial economy, underscores the site's significance for heritage policy. Furthermore, the monument's contestation reflects a broader European trend towards decolonizing heritage and embracing unconventional forms of historical tribute, ultimately prompting a fundamental re-evaluation of how we represent and remember the past.

The Melville Monument debate ultimately underscores the limits of symbolic gestures in addressing the unfinished business of history. Despite years of contention and the addition of multiple plaques, the monument's evolution reveals a profound sense of impotence, creating a fragmented and confusing narrative that fails to tell a complete story. The new plaque, intended as a step towards reconciliation, struggles to encapsulate the complex history of Henry Dundas and Scotland's role in the slave trade. Public disengagement, coupled with a focus on the \textit{delay} of abolition rather than the enduring reality of slavery itself, further highlights the inadequacy of purely symbolic actions. The transience of digital records, the constant editorializing of events, and the presence of academic bias all contribute to the difficulty of reconstructing a clear and objective historical narrative. Fundamentally, the Melville Monument raises critical questions about the politics of heritage: can it ever be truly apolitical? The historical reality of ruling classes dictating public narratives suggests that the struggle for inclusive and accurate representation is ongoing. Thus, the Melville Monument debate serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges in confronting complex historical legacies within a politically charged environment, questioning the very nature of heritage and its representation, and revealing that multiple plaques alone are insufficient to address the deep-seated complexities of the past.

\end{quote}

\subsection{Updated Plaque}\label{sec:reworded}

\begin{quote}
    {At the top of this neoclassical column stands a statue of Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville (1742-1811). He was the Scottish Lord Advocate, an MP for Edinburgh and Midlothian, and the First Lord of the Admiralty. Dundas was a contentious figure, provoking controversies that resonate to this day. While Home Secretary in 1792, and first Secretary of State for War in 1796 he was instrumental in deferring the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade. Slave trading by British ships was not abolished until 1807. As a result of this delay, more than half a million enslaved Africans crossed the Atlantic. Dundas also curbed democratic dissent in Scotland, and both defended and expanded the British empire, imposing colonial rule on indigenous peoples. He was impeached in the United Kingdom for misappropriation of public money, and, although acquitted, he never held public office again. Despite this, the monument before you was funded by voluntary contributions from British naval officers, petty officers, seamen, and marines
and was erected in 1821, with the statue placed on top in 1827. In 2020 this plaque was dedicated to the memory of the more than half-a-million Africans
whose enslavement was a consequence of Henry Dundas's actions.}

\section{Appendix: Call Instructions}
\textbf{Instructions for the mini research project which will be presented on March 6, 2025 in Paris.}

You will prepare an oral presentation in groups of 2-4 students (ideally from different Una Europa universities) on a case study of your choice that is related to the topic of colonial heritage in Europe. 



\begin{enumerate}
    \item You will provide some context on the nation-state where your case study is based on. The objective of this first part is to cast light on different European contexts, shaped by different colonial and imperial histories and racial formations. You will also expose the discussions and evolutions of heritage policies within the context of several antiracist and decolonial movements (RhodesMustFall, Black Lives Matter…). This part will be grounded in a critical review of relevant literature.
    \item You will focus on a public debate that has taken place recently in this European country raised by contestations around a monument, a statue, an exhibition or museum collections. This second part will identify the different actors involved in this debate and analyse their discourses. This section will be mostly based on secondary data, and eventually interviews (optional).
    \item  You will analyse alternative heritage practices which have been launched to make visible the \textit{trouble} around these heritage monuments / objects (artistic intervention, walking tour etc.). The objective of this section is to explore the role of a set of actors from below (but also in relation with institutional cultural institutions) that contribute to produce knowledge on the legacies of colonialism in Europe and create counter-hegemonic narratives and memories. 
\end{enumerate}

 The oral presentations will take place on March 6, 2025. Teams will have 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the group’s size, to present, followed by a 15-minute Q\&A, and everyone must participate in some capacity during the presentations.

Following the Workshop in Paris, each group will prepare an article, for the Blog “\href{https://herblog.hypotheses.org/}{Heritage on the Move}”, as well as an essay (on which the presentation will be based) to be submitted by March 31, 2025.
